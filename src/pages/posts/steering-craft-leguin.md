### First impressions

I wish someone had assigned this book when I was in college. It's absolutely gorgeous and nuts-and-bolts practical at the same time. This sort of writing advice, examples, and exercises meant to get you to expand your toolbox as a writer and look at writing in a whole different way are exactly what I needed then, and what I long for now. Iâ€™ll be going through this one rather slowly, since I actually intend to go through the exercises. Maybe some will make it onto the blog! Who knows.

### After the first exercises

I am SO RUSTY at writing, but I think this book is exactly what I need to dip my toes back into the waters of writing. I love the prompt to "write gorgeously" and to make it "feel like play." Gave me permission to really feel into the writing, and think about whether the words I was using felt like the emotions I was trying to convey. Fun stuff!
