Finally, finally, finally, I think I have this website how I want it, and I can start adding content. I do need to update the "Now" page with what I'm actually doing these days.

It feels really nice to have made this thing from scratch, and to be able to update and tinker with it however I like. It's a little sad that I'm coming into coding and learning to enjoy it just as shit's hitting the fan in the coding world (see [this blog post](https://carmenvankerckhove.substack.com/p/you-are-not-your-job-and-soon-you?r=h567&triedRedirect=true)), but maybe it's for the best. I don't need to be making a ton of money doing this; I just need to be having fun and making shit.

I better have something more interesting to say next time or this project will become entirely too navel-gaze-y for my own comfort.

Next time: thoughts about identity, culture, and capitalism? Maybe?
