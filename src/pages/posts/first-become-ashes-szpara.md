I read K. M. Szpara's first book, "Docile" a couple of years ago, and found it compelling in a disturbing way. Unfortunately, "First, Become Ashes" did not follow through on that promise. It wasn't as disturbing as Docile, but that's at least in part because it was much more confusing and scattered where Docile was incisive and pointed.

I wouldn't dissuade anyone from giving this one a shot, but Docile is a much better book.
