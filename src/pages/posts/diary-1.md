It's a good thing I love tinkering, because this coding my own website stuff is really putting me to the test!

I recently moved to Linux (Pop! OS) as my daily driver, which meant moving my Astro blog over to the computer. It was mostly just as easy as re-logging into GitHub, but since I hadn't touched stuff in months, Astro was out of date, which caused some issues. Spent HOURS trying to track down what the issue was until I tried updating Astro out of desperation, and that fixed everything.

Note to self: always update shit first, and see if that fixes things.
