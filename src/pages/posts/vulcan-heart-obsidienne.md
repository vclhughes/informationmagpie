### First impressions

Kirk and Spock get together a lot faster in this fic than in 
most k/s fanfic I've read recently--and this is a long fic, 120k. 
It'll be interesting to see where the conflict comes from--though 
I'm really enjoying seeing Kirk process having died and come back.

### 33%

Alright, so this is a relatively light and fluffy fic, 
with most of the "drama" coming from small 
misunderstandings in Kirk and Spock's relationship, and 
Kirk's issues from previous relationships. Generally 
cozy, very readable. Love a low stakes healing/figuring 
shit out fic.
