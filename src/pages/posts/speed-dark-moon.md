Sci-fi from an autistic person's perspective where the main character's job is being threatened if he doesn't participate in trials of a new treatment that promise to make him "normal."

I know that the saying is "If you've met one person with autism... you've met one person with autism," but I really wonder if my autistic friends would recognize themselves in this portrayal, since Lou is portrayed as understanding much less about the people he is around than my friends who identify that way seem to--though perhaps this is much more intense autism than they experience. I'm enjoying the book, but I worry that it's perhaps a little paternalistic towards its subject.

### Update

I'm about 75% of the way through the book and I'm really rooting for Lou to not take the treatment. I think we're past the main violence/outward conflict, and I deeply, truly hope that that experience doesn't push Lou over the edge towards wanting to be "normal." The scientists seem sus as hell.

### Finished the book - SPOILERS

He took the treatment to cure his autism, and it was sad and scary for a bit because he couldn't remember anything from before his treatment, and recovery took a lot longer than expected. But in the end he's happy and able to pursue his dream of going into space because he took the treatment. There are no real downsides for him. Knowing that Elizabeth Moon has an autistic child, this feels a lot like wish fulfillment. I liked the theme of not being afraid to change and become something new, to take a risk, but I don't think this was the right subject for that theme. Wish I could recommend, but I can't.
