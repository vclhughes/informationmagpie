  <h2>Now Page</h2>
  <p><i>Last updated June 5, 2025</i></p>
  <p>I recently graduated with a Masters in Information from Rutgers University, so I have to admit that I find myself a little aimless at the moment, and focused on finding things that I want to do after three years of full time work and part time school.</p>
  <h3>Reading</h3>
  <h4><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/8612644" >The Promise of the World</a> by pilindiel on Ao3</h4>
  <p>Pretty much Miyazaki’s Howl’s Moving Castle but with Yuri!!! on Ice characters’ names subbed in, but cozy and sweet.</p>
  <h4><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/fb06ced0-a5e8-483d-9f93-05cdb2fd46e9">The Feminist Killjoy Handbook</a> by Sarah Ahmed</h4>
  <p>Very wordy, poetic, and chewy. It’s taking me a while to get through this one, but it’s giving me a lot to think about.</p>
  <h3>Playing</h3>
  <h4>Baldur’s Gate 3</h4>
  <p>Both with my wife, where I play a butch drow, and solo, where I’ve recreated my first ever D&amp;D character, Welris, a scrungly middle-aged wizard of a gnome.</p>
  <h4>Coral Island</h4>
  <p>Like Stardew Valley, but I can help clean up the oceans! Very cute and relaxing.</p>
  <h3>This Website</h3>
  <p>I am in the process of finalizing this website and figuring out what the hell I want to use it for. I want to write and learn in public, and connect to the small web, but I’m honestly not sure what that will look like going forward. Maybe there will be fiction tidbits, maybe I’ll write more personal essays. I really want to get in the habit of writing for myself instead of for a class again, in whatever form that takes.</p>
  <p>I’m also trying to find copies of my personal essays that I wrote during the pandemic. I know I posted them somewhere, and have scrivener files that contain them, but it’s hard to dig them out.&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Digital Art</h3>
  <p>I’m teaching myself to draw in Krita.</p>
